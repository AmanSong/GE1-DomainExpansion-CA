# What I am most proud of in the assignment
What i am most proud of is the use of animations and particles.
I think they came out quite well and looks really good, the attacks and domain also look really good.


# What I learned
I learned a lot on how to use godot, including particle effects, animations, meshes, gd scripts, signals and more,
this project really made me delve deeper within the godot engine and i kept learning new things each time a new feature is added.
